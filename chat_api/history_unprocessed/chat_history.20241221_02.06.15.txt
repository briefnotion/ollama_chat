CLOCK SKEW DETECTED
I don't see a summary of our conversation. Can you please provide the summary, and I'll be happy to continue the conversation?
YOU:
     what is the giblet?
 AI:
     The giblet is actually a part of a roasted chicken that is often removed during cooking. It's typically the internal organs, such as:

* Giblets (the neck and throat area)
* Gizzards
* Heart
* Liver
* Lungs
* Tomatoes (yes, you read that right - some people use the tomato parts from the chicken cavity)

Giblets were originally used in soups, stews, or sauces to add flavor. However, they're not always considered appetizing today, and many cooks choose to discard them.

But here's a fun fact: giblets can still be useful even if you don't use them in cooking. Some people use the giblets to make a homemade chicken broth, as the organs contain collagen and other nutrients that can add depth to a stock.

Nowadays, most supermarkets sell pre-packed, pre-cleaned giblets in their poultry sections, which makes it easier for cooks to dispose of or reuse them.

Would you like to know more about cooking with giblets or making homemade chicken broth?
YOU:
     ah so close.
 AI:
     It seems I got a bit sidetracked in my explanation. To get back on track, I didn't actually receive a summary of our conversation from you, and we just started discussing the term "giblet". If you'd like to share the original context or starting point of our conversation, I'd be happy to continue!
YOU:
     bye
