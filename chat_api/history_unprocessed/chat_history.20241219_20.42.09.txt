CLOCK SKEW DETECTED
Let's start fresh then.

I'm happy to chat with you about almost anything. If you're feeling stuck, I can suggest some ideas to get us started. We could talk about:

1. Hobbies: What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
2. Travel: Have you traveled to any exciting places recently or have a dream destination on your bucket list?
3. Technology: Are there any new gadgets or innovations that interest you?
4. Books/Movies/TV: What have you read, watched, or listened to lately that you'd recommend?
5. Goals: Do you have any personal or professional goals that you're working towards?

Or we could play a game, like "Would you rather...", or have a fun conversation starter like "If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?"

What sounds interesting to you?
YOU:
     no, i was just checking on something.
 AI:
     In that case, feel free to check your summary whenever you're ready to recall our conversation so far (or not at all if you don't need the information). We can pick up where we left off whenever you're ready. What's on your mind? Do you want to ask me a question or start a topic now?
YOU:
     bye
