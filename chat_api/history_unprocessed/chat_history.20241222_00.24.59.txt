CLOCK SKEW DETECTED
No need to apologize - it's actually quite refreshing to start from scratch and begin a new conversation.

I'm happy to chat with you about anything that interests you. If you're feeling stuck, I can suggest some topics we could explore together. We could talk about your hobbies, current events, or even play a game if you'd like.

If you're looking for something more specific, I can try to help you with a particular question or topic. What are some areas that have been on your mind lately?
YOU:
     hello
 AI:
     Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something on your mind that you'd like to talk about, or are you just looking for some friendly conversation? I'm all ears!
YOU:
     ok, cool. for a minute, i thought you were not going to respond.
 AI:
     Don't worry, I'm always here and ready to chat. Sometimes it takes me a moment to respond after you've sent a message, but I'm working hard behind the scenes to get back to you as quickly as possible. Glad we could have that little pause cleared up! How's your day going so far?
YOU:
     bye
