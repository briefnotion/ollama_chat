CLOCK SKEW DETECTED
YOU:
     go into maintenance mode
 AI:
     I'm not capable of entering a "maintenance mode" in the classical sense. I am a computer program designed to process and respond to natural language inputs, and I don't have the ability to physically shut down or become unavailable.

However, I can indicate that I will be temporarily unavailable for maintenance purposes by providing a message like this:

"I'm currently undergoing maintenance. Please check back later when I'll be available again."

If you need assistance with something urgent, please feel free to try again later and I'll do my best to help.

I don't have information on ChromaDB commands for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support. Can I help you with something else?
