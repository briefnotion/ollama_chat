CLOCK SKEW DETECTED
I see that we've started fresh, and there's no previous conversation to recall. You'd like me to summarize our conversation and provide explanations for any topics you'd like to explore.

Since we didn't have a previous conversation prior to this one, let's start with the basics. We can discuss any topic you're interested in, and I'll do my best to provide clear explanations and additional information as needed.

If you'd like to recall our conversation later, we can use the methods I mentioned earlier: recap, notes, or viewing the conversation history (if available).
YOU:
     what was the first thing said?
 AI:
     The first thing said in our conversation was your statement that "Cant recall previouse conversation." However, since this was the start of our conversation, there was no previous conversation to recall. We began with a blank slate!
YOU:
     ah, i didnt save the code.
 AI:
     No worries, it's easy to lose track of conversation history or notes.

If you'd like, we can start fresh and explore any topic you'd like. I'm here to help with any questions or provide information on a wide range of subjects. Just let me know what's on your mind!
YOU:
     bye
