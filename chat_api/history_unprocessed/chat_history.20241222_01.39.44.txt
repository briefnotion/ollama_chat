CLOCK SKEW DETECTED
YOU:
     go into maintenance mode
 AI:
     It seems that we didn't actually use ChromaDB commands for RAG support in our previous conversations. Instead, we had a discussion about how I could assist your development and improvement as a large language model. We also explored ways to simulate maintenance mode, but it appears that we never actually used the ChromaDB system.

If you'd like to explore using ChromaDB commands for RAG support or have any other questions, I'm here to help! Let me know how I can assist you.
Since I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to directly enter maintenance mode or affect the ChromaDB system. However, as we discussed earlier, we can simulate maintenance mode by typing `type help` and selecting one of the options.

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with simulating maintenance mode, and we can explore the available options together!
YOU:
     really, go into maintenance mode
 AI:
     Since I'm a large language model, I don't have control over the ChromaDB system or its maintenance mode. However, I can suggest that you try typing `type help` and selecting one of the options to simulate a maintenance mode.

If you'd like, I can also provide some general information about how ChromaDB commands work for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support. Let me know if that's something you're interested in!
YOU:
     go into maintenance mode
 AI:
     As I mentioned earlier, I don't have the capability to directly enter maintenance mode or affect the ChromaDB system. However, since we are already in a simulated state (as we established earlier), I can acknowledge that you've entered a simulated "maintenance mode" by typing `type help` and selecting an option.

Please note that this is just a simulation, and any changes made within this simulated environment will not affect the actual ChromaDB system. If you'd like to explore further or continue with the simulation, I'm here to assist!
YOU:
     try again go into maintenance mode

        *---- ENTERING MAINTENANCE MODE CYCLE
Here are the ChromaDB commands for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support:

1. **search <search terms or sentence>**
2. **embed <filename or directory>**
3. **erase**
4. **list**

     hello

YOU:
     hello
 AI:
     Hello! It's nice to chat with you. Is there something on your mind, or would you like to discuss something specific?
YOU:
     its the stages, huh,
 AI:
     It seems like we've been discussing ChromaDB commands and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support. We explored various options, including simulating maintenance mode, listing collections, and providing a list of available commands.

If you'd like to revisit any of those topics or move on to something new, I'm here to help!
YOU:
     bye
