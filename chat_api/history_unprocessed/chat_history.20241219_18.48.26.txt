     I'm glad you enjoyed them! I have a lot more where those came from, if you're interested in hearing some more. Do you have a specific topic or theme you'd like to hear jokes about? (e.g. puns, animals, technology, etc.)?

Also, would you like me to try and come up with some longer-form jokes, like one-liners or short stories, instead of just quick punchlines?
